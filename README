Dateshift
=========

Datesfit is a tool for shifting date/time. In particular it allows a
process or set of process to run with a different clock setting,
_without having to change the system clock.

This is useful because changing the system clock is requires root
priviledge and is inconvienient on shared machines.

Some example uses:

* Use dateshift to test your finance package on 29th Feb

* Use dateshift to find out what happens whren unix time wraps around in 2037.

* Use dateshift to test your new clock program!

See the man page for user documentation.
